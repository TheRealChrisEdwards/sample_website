A sample website for **Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**

This project was created to be a learning guide for HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, by following the online tutorial at **Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**. There several different valuable tutorials for learning basic Command-Line, Text-Editor, Git & HTML skills at the **Learn Enough** website. There's even a **Learn Enough CSS to Be Dangerous** tutorial currently under development, which will show how to implement & manipulate Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling HTML documents. While there are many different "learning HTML" tutorials on the web, **Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous** stands out, because it only covers the most important features in building a webpage using the **HTML5 standard** from **W3C** & utilizing Git to deploy a live webpage, by using **GH-Pages on GitHub**.

For more information on this tutorial, visit the **Learn Enough to Be Dangerous** website. 

For more information on different projects that I'm working on, visit **TheRealChrisEdwards** public repository on GitHub. I also have a blog under development, called **TRCE** on **WordPress**, documenting my journey learning web development.
