A sample website for Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous

This project was created to be a learning guide for HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, by following the tutorial at **Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**. There several different valuable tutorials for learning basic Command-Line, Text-Editor, Git & HTML at the Learn Enough website. There's even a Learn Enough CSS to Be Dangerous tutorial currently under development. While there are many different "learning HTML" tutorials on the web, **Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous** stands out, because it only covers the most important features in building a webpage using HTML & utilizing Git to deploy a live webpage. For more information on this tutorial, visit **Learn Enough to Be Dangerous** website. For more information on different projects that I'm working on, visit **TheRealChrisEdwards** public repository on GitHub. I also have a blog under development, called TRCE on WordPress, documenting my journey learning web development. If you'd like more background information on any of these sites, or technologies used, visit **Wikipedia** to find out more!
