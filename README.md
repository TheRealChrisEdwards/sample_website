A sample website for **Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**

This project was created to be a learning guide for HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, by following the online tutorial at [**Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**](https://learnenough.com/html-tutorial). There are several different valuable tutorials for learning basic Command-Line, Text-Editor, Git & HTML skills at the [**Learn Enough**](https://learnenough.com) website. There's even a **Learn Enough CSS to Be Dangerous** tutorial currently under development, which will show how to implement & manipulate Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling HTML documents. While there are many different "learning HTML" tutorials on the web, [**Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**](https://learnenough.com/html-tutorial) stands out, because it only covers the most important features in building a webpage using the [**HTML5 standard**](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5) from [**W3C**](http://www.w3.org) & utilizing Git to deploy a live webpage, by using [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com).

For more information on this tutorial, visit the [**Learn Enough to Be Dangerous**](https://learnenough.com) website.

I also have a blog under development, called [**TRCE**](https://therealchrisedwards.tech.blog/) on [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.com), documenting my journey learning web development.
