A sample website for **Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**

This project was created to be a learning guide for HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, by following the online tutorial at [**Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**](https://learnenough.com/html-tutorial). There are several different valuable tutorials for learning basic Command-Line, Text-Editor, Git & HTML skills at the [**Learn Enough**](https://learnenough.com) website. There's even a **Learn Enough CSS to Be Dangerous** tutorial currently under development, which will show how to implement & manipulate Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling HTML documents. While there are many different "learning HTML" tutorials on the web, [**Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous**](https://learnenough.com/html-tutorial) stands out, because it only covers the most important features in building a webpage using the [**HTML5 standard**](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5) from [**W3C**](http://www.w3.org) & utilizing Git to deploy a live webpage, by using [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com).

For more information on this tutorial, visit the [**Learn Enough to Be Dangerous**](https://learnenough.com) website. 

For more information on different projects that I'm working on, visit **TheRealChrisEdwards** public repository on GitHub. I also have a blog under development, called **TRCE** on [**WordPress**](http://www.wordpress.org), documenting my journey learning web development.
